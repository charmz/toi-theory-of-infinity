# Specification: Rigorous LaTeX-to-Axiomatic Formalization Policy

This policy defines procedures and standards for converting LaTeX documents into formal axiomatic frameworks, especially in contexts with both mathematical rigor and philosophical exposition.  The goal is to produce a comprehensive formalization that faithfully captures **every** declared definition, axiom, theorem, and logical claim from the source, while preserving historical and conceptual nuance.  The guidelines below build on the methodology in *gptmeta.txt* and examples such as Cantor’s 1897 reconstruction.  They are intended as an internal guide for analysts or automated tools to ensure the output is logically complete, traceable, and true to the original text.

## Extraction of Formal Components

* **Detect all declared items.**  Scan the LaTeX source for every instance of theorem-like declarations and definitions (e.g. environments or commands such as `\begin{definition}`, `\begin{theorem}`, `\begin{axiom}`, or custom `\newtheorem` entries).  Each defined **Definition**, **Axiom**, **Theorem**, **Lemma**, or **Proposition** in the text must appear in the formal output. Likewise, look for implicit definitions or assumptions stated in prose (e.g. “we define…” or “assume that…” outside of an environment) and extract these as formal entries.  *Example:* In the Cantor framework, key terms like “set”, “cardinal”, and “Absolute Infinite” were systematically identified and given precise definitions.  All named entities in the source must correspond to an output entry of the same name (or an equivalent representation). If any declared item is missed, or if the conversion produces an extra formal statement not grounded in the text, this discrepancy is flagged for review.
* **Enumerate and name entries.** Each extracted element should be clearly labeled and numbered. For instance, use the format **Definition 1 (Term): …**, **Axiom 2 (Name): …**, **Theorem 1 (Statement): …** as in the example frameworks.  This consistent naming (with unique identifiers and optional descriptive titles) allows traceability. If the source names an axiom or theorem, use that name in parentheses after the number. All such entries must be listed under corresponding headings (e.g. a dedicated *Definitions* section, an *Axioms* section, etc.) in the output.

## Preserving Logical Dependencies

* **Link statements to their foundations.** For every theorem or derived proposition, record which definitions and axioms it depends on.  The conversion should include explicit references (by identifier) to the supporting axioms or earlier theorems. This ensures each result is traceable to its assumptions and basic concepts.  For example, if Theorem 3 relies on Axiom 1 and Definition 2, the formal writeup should note this dependency.  In practice, one may append notes or annotations like *“(follows from Definition 2 and Axiom 1)”*.  This mirrors how formal systems annotate derivations, guaranteeing that the reader can follow the logical chain.  In sample frameworks, each axiom or theorem is introduced with context linking it back to the source text, and analogous cross-links should be added in our output.
* **Maintain argument structure.** Preserve the order and structure of logical argumentation implied by the source. If the LaTeX text proves a theorem by referencing certain definitions or earlier lemmas, the formalization should reflect that order.  Do not reorder definitions or axioms in a way that obscures their use.  This may require analyzing the LaTeX or accompanying proof text to infer which premises are intended.  If the source uses non-standard inference or explanatory text, capture that as either formal inference steps or marked commentary.  The output should effectively reconstruct the original logical flow, so that every conclusion can be followed from earlier premises.

## Consistency and Completeness Checks

* **Cross-check source vs output.** After conversion, perform a one-to-one comparison between the LaTeX and the formal document. Every labeled element (definition, axiom, theorem, etc.) in the source must appear once in the formal output. Conversely, no formal statement should lack a corresponding source statement. Any mismatch—such as a theorem in the source that is missing in output, or an extra formal statement not present in source—must be highlighted.  This is akin to the “detect anomalies” step in formalization methodology.  A simple checklist approach (listing all source items and matching them to output items) can be used to ensure nothing was omitted or added inadvertently.
* **Resolve contradictions and ambiguities.** If the source text contains contradictory claims or unclear terminology, flag these issues. The formalization should not silently ignore contradictions (e.g. an axiom that violates another axiom) nor ambiguous terms. Instead, annotate them in the output. For instance, if Cantor’s prose implies a “set of all sets” (which is problematic in ZF set theory), this paradox should be explicitly noted, as recommended by general formalization principles. Likewise, if a term is used inconsistently, record that finding. These flags help ensure the final framework is as coherent and safe as possible.
* **Validate formal consistency.** Whenever possible, verify that the extracted axioms and definitions do not directly conflict. For example, check that no axiom is a triviality or has an outright logical contradiction. This can be done informally (via review) or with automated consistency checking if tools are available. The policy does not require proving consistency, but it does require noting any suspect combination (e.g. an axiom saying “Axiom 1 and Axiom 2 cannot both hold”) so the user is aware of potential issues.

## Cross-Validation of Natural Language vs Formal Content

* **Match claims to formal backing.** Every substantive claim made in the text must have a formal counterpart. If the LaTeX narrative asserts a proposition, that proposition should appear as a theorem, lemma, or axiom in the output (as appropriate). Conversely, if there is a formal statement in the output (e.g. a derived theorem) that was not clearly claimed in the text, this should be noted. The conversion should systematically ensure that no informal claim is left unjustified. This reflects the principle that the formal system “captures all core assertions” of the source.
* **Label non-formalized claims.** Sometimes the author may include speculative or heuristic reasoning (especially in philosophical or historical exposition). If such content cannot be cleanly translated into a proof or axiom, explicitly mark it as *“heuristic”* or *“informal note”* in the output. For example, if Cantor philosophically discusses the “transcendent” nature of the Absolute Infinite without a clear formal statement, this should not silently become an axiom. Instead, the text can include a comment like “(Historical/Philosophical remark: …)” or “(Heuristic conjecture: …)”. This ensures the reader sees which parts are rigorous formal claims and which are interpretative commentary.  In well-formalized examples, analogous differentiations are made between axioms and broader context; our policy requires the same clarity.
* **Ensure precise definition of terms.** Mirroring *gptmeta*’s Step 4, all key terms must be clearly defined. If a term is used informally in prose, the conversion must include a formal definition or axiomatic characterization of that term. If an exact definition is not present in the source, the converter should either omit the term from formal use or supply a provisional definition (noting it as such). In practice, create a *Definitions* section listing each term with a precise description (e.g. “Definition 3 (Absolute Infinite): …”), following the style shown in successful frameworks. This prevents hidden assumptions: as soon as a concept appears, the output specifies what it means in this formal context.

## Preserving Historical and Philosophical Context

* **Respect original framing.** When the source contains historical or philosophical exposition (as in Cantor’s 1897 text), the formalization must **not** erase that flavor. Preserve original terminology and conceptual framing by quoting or paraphrasing it in the narrative parts of the formal document. For example, Cantor’s emphasis on “transcendent” versus “successive” infinities should be noted when introducing the Absolute Infinite in the formal axioms. Kepler’s invocation of a divine Creator was included as a philosophical premise in the axiomatic reconstruction; similarly, any such background premise in the source should be explicitly stated in the introduction or as an axiom (with a note about its role). However, keep this context in a separate explanatory layer: do not mingle theological/philosophical content directly into mathematical definitions without marking it. The formal core (definitions, axioms, theorems) should remain rigorously stated, while commentary can carry the nuance.
* **Use original terminology where possible.** The policy encourages reusing the author’s own labels and phrasing for concepts, provided they are clearly defined. For instance, if Cantor calls something an “Absolute Infinite”, use that term in the formal text (while giving a precise meaning) rather than renaming it arbitrarily. This maintains fidelity to the author’s intent. Wherever we diverge from the original wording (for modern clarity or rigor), note it explicitly.  This follows the principle of *historical-scientific alignment* seen in Kepler’s formalization, where original concepts (e.g. Platonic solids, consonances) were faithfully captured in formal terms.
* **Maintain narrative structure in the output.** In documents that blend exposition and formalism, structure the output so that historical notes and logical statements are clearly separated. For example, use prose paragraphs to give historical context or explain the motivation, then use well-delimited sections or bullet points for formal definitions and axioms. In practice, place philosophical commentary before or after the formal sections, or interleave short notes in *italics* after a definition to explain its origin. Always signal which text is “formal rule” vs “explanatory note”. The Cantor framework did this by italicizing context after each axiom; such styling conventions should be documented in gptlatex.txt so that future conversions remain consistent.

## Formatting and Annotation Conventions

* **Document structure.** Organize the output in a clear, consistent hierarchy. A typical structure is:

  1. **Introduction/Scope:** Outline the source’s context and the goals of formalization (briefly, to frame the content).
  2. **Definitions:** List all key concepts with clear formal definitions (numbered as Definition 1, Definition 2, etc.).
  3. **Axioms:** State all foundational assumptions or postulates (numbered Axiom 1, Axiom 2, …). Each can include a brief note (in parentheses or italics) linking it to the source text.
  4. **Theorems/Propositions:** Present derived results (numbered Theorem 1, Theorem 2, etc.), each prefaced by which axioms or definitions it uses.
  5. **(Optional) Lemmas/Corollaries:** If needed for structure, with numbering continuing or separate.
  6. **Discussion/Consistency:** An optional section noting consistency with modern theory or unresolved issues, as seen in examples.
     Headings should be in Markdown (e.g. `## Definitions`, `## Axioms`, etc.) for readability.
* **Stylistic details.** Follow formatting cues demonstrated in existing frameworks: use boldface for terms being defined (e.g. **Definition 1 (X):** …), and italic text for supplementary remarks.  Equations or logical formulas should be clearly delimited (e.g. using `$…$` for inline math). If citations or references to the original LaTeX sections are needed, place them in footnotes or parentheses (consistent with the style of *gptlatex.txt*). Ensure uniform indentation and bullet styles for lists, as seen in the repository examples. Consistency in formatting makes the formal document easily navigable for both programmatic parsing and human review.
* **Programmatic annotations.** To aid validation, it is helpful to insert identifiable markers or labels in the text. For instance, label each formal entry with a unique identifier (like `Axiom1`, `Def2`) that a program can parse. The policy should specify any such required tokens (if used by the conversion tooling). Likewise, if the process uses a particular comment prefix (e.g. `% NOTE:`) to flag issues or unmatched content, document this convention. The sample outputs do not show a strict template beyond Markdown, but if `gptlatex.txt` expects certain patterns (for automated checks), those should be enumerated here.

By adhering to these guidelines, every element of the source LaTeX will be accounted for, and the resulting formal framework will be a precise, self-contained reconstruction of the theory.  The policy ensures *completeness* (no definitions or axioms are lost) and *fidelity* (all claims are either formalized or flagged) while respecting the original document’s context.  Together, these rules enable thorough, high-integrity conversions of even complex philosophical-mathematical texts into logical form.

**Sources:** This policy’s approach is informed by the formalization specification in *gptmeta.txt* and examples of historical-theory formalizations (e.g. Cantor 1897, Kepler 1618). They illustrate the need to extract every stated statement and maintain cross-links, while embedding historical exposition alongside rigorous definitions.
