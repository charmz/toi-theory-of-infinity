note      = {Minkowski's famous lecture “Space and Time” declared that \emph{“Space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away… Only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.”} He introduced the four-dimensional spacetime continuum, unifying space and time into a single geometric entity. This theoretical insight provided the framework for Einstein's relativity, revolutionizing the concept of space from an absolute void or container to a dynamic, four-dimensional manifold.}

date      = {-0200?},
note      = {Apollonius's treatise \emph{Conics} introduced terminology and notions still used in geometry. In particular, Apollonius defined the principal axes of conic sections (for example, the transverse and conjugate axes of a hyperbola, or the axis of symmetry of a parabola). This represents one of the earliest uses of the concept of an “axis” as a fundamental reference line defining the symmetry of a shape. The geometric axis in Apollonius's work laid groundwork for the idea of an axis as a central line about which structure is organized.}

note      = {In \emph{De Revolutionibus}, Copernicus proposed the revolutionary idea that Earth rotates daily about its own axis and revolves annually around the Sun. By asserting Earth's axial rotation, Copernicus introduced a cosmic “axis” as a real, physical line through Earth's poles around which the planet spins. This use of the axis concept was pivotal in astronomy: it explained the daily motion of the heavens by Earth's rotation about an axis, fundamentally changing our understanding of the world's orientation in space.}

note      = {Descartes's \emph{La Géométrie} introduced the Cartesian coordinate system. By choosing an arbitrary origin and two perpendicular axes (later called the \$x\$---\$y\$ axes) on a plane, Descartes established a method to represent geometric points with algebraic pairs of numbers. The notion of an origin (0,0) and fixed axes for reference was groundbreaking: it provided a universal fulcrum for translating geometric shapes into equations. The coordinate axis concept has since become fundamental in mathematics and physics as the pivot around which space is measured and symmetric relations are defined.}

In his system, logical statements correspond to set operations, and the universe of discourse contains subsets representing propositions. Boole implicitly deals with subsets through concepts like the “universal class” (universe) and the “null class” (empty set), as well as intersections and unions of classes. This was a precursor to formal set theory: it showed how subsets of a universe could be combined or related logically, setting the stage for later mathematicians to treat subsets rigorously.}

He proved that the set of all real algebraic numbers is countable, but hinted (and soon proved) that the set of all real numbers is uncountable—meaning it cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. Though the word “subset” is not explicitly used, Cantor's reasoning compares the subset of algebraic numbers to the larger continuum of reals. This revolutionary work laid the groundwork for the formal treatment of subsets and set size (cardinality) in later set theory.}

Dedekind exhibits an infinite set by showing the natural numbers are in one-to-one correspondence with a proper subset (e.g., map \$n \mapsto n+1\$). This was a landmark in set theory—it explicitly uses the concept of subset (and proper subset) to characterize infinity, highlighting the theoretical importance of subsets in understanding the nature of number and infinity.}

Specifically, Cantor showed that the set of all subsets of the natural numbers is uncountable, establishing an infinite hierarchy of ever-larger infinities. This result highlights the profound idea of iterated subset formation—\$S\$ leads to \$2^S\$, then \$2^{2^S}\$, and so on—each new “subset of subsets” creating a larger universe. It exemplifies how applying the subset operation twice (and more) generates a recursive tower of larger and richer sets.}

note    = {Zermelo's groundbreaking paper presented the first axiomatic set theory. Two of its axioms directly pertain to subsets: the Axiom of Separation (Subset Axiom) formalizes the idea that for any set, one can form subsets of it defined by a property; and the Axiom of Power Set guarantees that for any set X, there exists a set \mathcal{P}(X) that contains all subsets of X. In particular, the Power Set axiom secures the existence of the “set of subsets” (subset^2) as a new mathematical object. Zermelo's work thus enshrined the subset and power-set operations as fundamental building blocks in the hierarchy of sets.}

A fractal can be thought of as a subset that contains scaled copies of itself. This idea of recursive self-containing structure parallels subset^2 in that subsets of a system can themselves have sub-sub-structures ad infinitum. Mandelbrot's work showed how simple iterative rules (each step creating subsets within subsets) can generate infinitely complex patterns, providing a modern illustration of emergent complexity from recursive subset formation.}

He hypothesized that hexagonal packing of spheres (like cannonballs stacked in a pyramid) is the most efficient way to fill space. This early insight essentially describes a two-dimensional lattice (hexagonal lattice) of points. Kepler's speculation on natural packing and symmetry was a precursor to lattice concepts in crystallography, where atoms arrange in repetitive symmetric grids. It marks one of the first recognitions that a regular repetitive geometric arrangement (a lattice) underlies a natural form.}

He showed that there are precisely 14 distinct types of three-dimensional point lattices (now called Bravais lattices) that can fill space periodically. Each lattice is an infinite array of points (or atoms) repeating in a regular pattern. Bravais's work provided the theoretical scaffolding for understanding crystal structures as arrangements of identical building blocks on lattice points. It represents the formal emergence of the lattice as a fundamental structural concept in both geometry and matter.}

In mathematics, a “lattice” is an ordered set in which any two elements have a greatest lower bound and least upper bound (join and meet). Birkhoff unified various examples (boolean algebras, subgroups, etc.) under lattice theory, turning it into a branch of algebra. This work solidified the lattice as a theoretical concept beyond geometry—capturing the idea of a grid-like partial order structure that can model order and combination in diverse areas of math.}

This eternal, unchanging first cause is said to initiate all motion without itself being moved. Aristotle's unmoved mover can be seen as a philosophical notion of an “origin” of motion and order in the universe—a primal source that sets everything in motion.

By naming the light quantum as “photon,” Lewis gave a permanent identity to the concept of a light particle. The introduction of the term helped solidify the concept in both the literature and the imagination of physicists, marking the photon's entry into the lexicon of science.}
